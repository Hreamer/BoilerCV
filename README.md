### How to test  
First go to the client folder and run `npm run build`. If there is a build folder previously there before the command is run delete it to make sure the build is latest. After this, to test the app simply `cd` into the Backend folder and run `go run .`. This will start the backend service on the port 3333(Port number could change but for now it works).
